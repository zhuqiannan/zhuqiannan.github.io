I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Institute of Information Engineering](https://iie.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://ucas.ac.cn/), under the supervision of Associate Prof. Xiaofei Zhou and Prof. Jianlong Tan. <br>
I received my Bachelor's degree in [Hennan University](http://en.henu.edu.cn) in Henan, China.

# Research
My research interests mainly lie in large scale machine learning with theoretical guarantees and efficient algorithms, but also kernel selection and graph-based semi-supervised learning. <br>
In facts, my works focus on generalization analysis of those areas and building effective and scalable algorithmic tools for them, to channel theory and algorithms into applications.
